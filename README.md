# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## What is Requirement Analysis?”
This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of requirement analysis in software development. 

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC), where developers, analysts, and stakeholders gather and define the functional and non-functional requirements of a system. This helps ensure that the final product aligns with user needs and business goals.

The goal of this repository is to provide resources, examples, and documentation related to effective requirement analysis techniques, tools, and best practices.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Improves Project Clarity and Scope Definition**  
   Requirement analysis ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the project goals, deliverables, and boundaries. It minimizes ambiguity and helps define what is in and out of scope.

2. **Reduces Development Costs and Rework**  
   Identifying requirements early in the SDLC helps prevent costly mistakes later. Well-defined requirements reduce the chances of rework caused by missing features or misunderstood expectations.

3. **Enhances Communication Among Stakeholders**  
   A well-conducted requirement analysis process fosters collaboration between business stakeholders, developers, and users. It bridges the communication gap and ensures that all parties are aligned throughout the      project lifecycle.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis phase includes several critical activities to ensure a clear, complete, and validated set of requirements:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and existing documentation to understand business needs.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Actively engaging with stakeholders to uncover implicit, tacit, and emerging requirements using techniques like brainstorming, workshops, and use cases.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Clearly recording all gathered and elicited requirements in formats such as Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, or requirement models.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Evaluating, prioritizing, and organizing requirements. This may involve identifying dependencies, conflicts, and using models (e.g., data flow diagrams, UML) to visualize and analyze requirements.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring that documented requirements are complete, correct, feasible, and agreed upon by all stakeholders through reviews, walkthroughs, and approval sessions.

## Types of Requirements
Functional requirements describe the specific behavior or functions of the system
- **Examples**
  
- The system shall allow users to book a room by selecting check-in and check-out dates.

- The system shall send a confirmation email after a booking is completed.

- The system shall allow users to cancel or modify existing bookings.


## Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system—how the system performs its functions.
- **Examples**
- The booking system shall be available 99.9% of the time.
- The system shall respond to booking requests within 2 seconds.
- User data shall be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

**Definition:**  
Acceptance Criteria are a set of predefined conditions or statements that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by users, stakeholders, or the product owner. They serve as a bridge between requirements and testing.

**Importance in Requirement Analysis:**  
- Ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what "done" means for each requirement or user story.
- Provides a basis for writing test cases and verifying that the software meets business needs.
- Reduces ambiguity by defining specific expectations for functionality and performance.

**Example – Checkout Feature (Booking Management System):**

**User Story:**  
_As a registered user, I want to be able to complete a room booking checkout process so that I can reserve my stay._

**Acceptance Criteria**
- The system shall display a summary of the booking including dates, room details, and total cost.
- The user must be able to select a payment method (credit/debit card, mobile money, etc.).
- The user must receive a confirmation message and email upon successful payment.
- Payment transactions shall be securely processed with encryption.
- The system shall prevent checkout if required fields (e.g., payment details, user info) are missing or invalid.
